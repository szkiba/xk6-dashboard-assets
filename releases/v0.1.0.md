xk6-dashboard-assets `v0.1.0` is here 🎉!

## Overview

This is the first release of `xk6-dashboard-assets` as a standalone repository. The assets have been extracted from the [grafana/xk6-dashboard](https://github.com/grafana/xk6-dashboard) repository to simplify maintenance of the frontend components.

## What's Changed

- **Repository Split**: Frontend assets (UI, Report, and supporting packages) are now maintained separately from the main xk6-dashboard extension
- **Monorepo Structure**: Organized as a Lerna-managed monorepo with 5 packages:
  - `@xk6-dashboard-assets/config` - Configuration management
  - `@xk6-dashboard-assets/model` - Data models and types
  - `@xk6-dashboard-assets/view` - View utilities and formatters
  - `@xk6-dashboard-assets/report` - Static report single-page application
  - `@xk6-dashboard-assets/ui` - Live dashboard single-page application

## Technical Details

This repository is a Go module that provides embedded static assets for xk6-dashboard. The assets are designed to be embedded into the main xk6-dashboard Go extension using Go's `embed` package.

### Public API

The module exposes three public functions:

- **`func UI() fs.FS`** - Returns an embedded filesystem containing the live dashboard single-page application. This includes all HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and other assets needed for the interactive web interface.

- **`func Report() []byte`** - Returns the embedded HTML content for the static report single-page application. This is a self-contained HTML file that can be saved and viewed offline.

- **`func Config() json.RawMessage`** - Returns the embedded default configuration as raw JSON. This provides the default panel and visualization settings for the dashboard.

### Build Output

The embedded assets are located in:
- `packages/ui/dist/*` - Complete UI application bundle
- `packages/report/dist/index.html` - Standalone report HTML
- `packages/config/dist/config.json` - Default configuration
